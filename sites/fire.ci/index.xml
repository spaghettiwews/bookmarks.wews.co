      <description>A good CI build:
 Ensures no code that breaks basic stuff and prevents other team members to work is introduced to the main branch Is fast enough to provide feedback to developers within minutes to prevent context switching between tasks    A good CD build:
 Ensures that as many features as possible are working properly The faster the better, but it is not a matter of speed.</description>
